When you first run the application, you will see a web page with the following elements:

- A section for adding movies with a title, rating, and "Watched" toggle button.
- A "Sort Movies" button.
- A section to display the total number of movies in the list.
- A section to display movies with a rating higher than a specified value.
- The displayed movies are contained in boxes, colored green if their rating is 3.5 or higher, and red otherwise.

## Adding Movies
1. Initial movies are already added, such as "Spiderman," "Citizen Kane," and "Zootopia."
2. You can add a new movie via the console using the following code:
   ```javascript
   let newMovie = new Movie("Your Movie Title", 4.2, true);
   addMovie(newMovie);
